# About

Repository of solutions written for programming problems, as well as notes and code snippets implementing `data-structures` and algorithms. Will be updated whenever I work through additional material and questions. 

Also contains miscellaneous snippets for situations I normally come across and want to reference again, like `web-scraping`.

Languages: Python, SQL
